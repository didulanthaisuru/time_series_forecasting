Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):

MAPE measures the average percentage difference between actual and predicted values.

The result "inf%" (infinity) suggests that at least one actual value in your dataset is zero, causing a division by zero error when calculating percentage differences.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 53,920.57:

RMSE measures the standard deviation of prediction errors.

It penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones due to squaring the differences.

A high RMSE indicates that your model's predictions deviate significantly from actual values.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = 15,367.82:

MAE calculates the average absolute differences between predicted and actual values.

Unlike RMSE, MAE gives equal weight to all errors, making it more interpretable.

A MAE of 15,367.82 means, on average, your modelâ€™s predictions are off by this amount in absolute terms.
